# Installing Elsewhere

[Site](https://netmobster.github.io/elsewhere-idle-cc/) · [Repo](https://github.com/netmobster/elsewhere-idle-cc)

**Short version:** clone it, open Claude Code, type `/elsewhere`. That's it.

There is no installer because there is nothing to install. The game is six Python
files with no dependencies, and Claude Code builds everything else on first run.

---

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.9 or newer. `zoneinfo` is used for the world clock; on 3.8 it falls back to UTC. |
| **Claude Code** | Any recent version. The game is a slash command plus a Python engine. |
| **Packages** | None. Standard library only — `json`, `random`, `hashlib`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `html`. |
| **A server** | No. |
| **An account** | No. Worlds live in a file on your disk. |

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netmobster/elsewhere-idle-cc
cd elsewhere-idle-cc
```

Open Claude Code in that directory and type:

```
/elsewhere
```

The `/elsewhere` command ships in `.claude/commands/` inside the repo, so cloning
installs it. First run rolls a world, renders the board and takes your orders.

**If `/elsewhere` doesn't appear**, Claude Code loads its command list at startup —
restart the session and it will be there.

**If you already have a global `/elsewhere`** at `~/.claude/commands/elsewhere.md`
from an earlier copy, it can shadow the one in the repo, and you will find yourself
playing the old world from the new directory. Delete the global one, or make it
locate `engine.py` in the working directory first. The command that ships in the
repo is path-agnostic and needs no configuration.

## Where things live

```
elsewhere-idle-cc/
├── .claude/commands/elsewhere.md   the play command
├── engine.py                       truth
├── render.py                       the board
├── epilogue.py                     the ending
├── sim.py                          fast-forward, for testing
├── bench.py                        the balance harness
├── state.json                      your live world  (created on first run)
├── story.md                        the chronicle     (written when a world ends)
├── elsewhere-board.html            the board         (rendered each turn)
├── epilogue.html                   the ending        (written when a world ends)
└── worlds/                         archived worlds   (one JSON per finished game)
```

`state.json`, `story.md`, `elsewhere-board.html` and `worlds/` are all created for
you. Nothing else is generated.

---

## Seeing the board

**Every plan:** `elsewhere-board.html` is a normal HTML file. Double-click it, or
open it from the browser. It refreshes each time the game renders — reload to see
the new state.

**With Claude Code Artifacts:** the board publishes to a live pane beside the chat
that updates as you play, which is considerably nicer. Artifacts are currently a
Team/Enterprise feature. **The game does not require them.**

---

## Playing without the slash command

Everything is a plain CLI if you'd rather drive it yourself:

```bash
python engine.py new                  # roll a world
python engine.py watch "Long Hand"    # focus one neighbour
python engine.py watch general        # or watch all three from the hill
python engine.py queue "Slow them|long-hand|disrupt" "Trade|long-hand|trade"
python engine.py ff 8h                # fast-forward (h = hours, bare = days)
python engine.py tick                 # advance to now, honestly
python engine.py horizon              # what is coming, and when
python engine.py status               # the whole state as JSON
python render.py                      # rebuild the board
```

Order kinds: `disrupt` 60 · `fortify` 50 · `trade` 20 · `scout` 30 · `invest` 40 ·
`mega` (costs everything, minimum 150).

The chat layer is what makes it a game rather than a spreadsheet, but the engine
runs perfectly well without it.

---

## Testing and balance

```bash
python bench.py 12       # four strategies, twelve seeds, six criteria
python sim.py            # run all strategies once, quickly
python sim.py attentive 21
```

`bench.py` exits non-zero on a failing build, so it works in CI.

---

## Starting over

```bash
rm state.json story.md
python engine.py new
```

Finished worlds are already archived in `worlds/`, so nothing is lost.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"The board looks stale."** Run `python render.py`. The board is rendered, not live —
it only changes when the game does.

**"Nothing happened when I ticked."** Time is real. `engine.py tick` advances to *now*,
so if less than eight hours have passed there is nothing to advance. Use
`ff 8h` while testing.

**"My order was called off."** That is the game. An order resolves against the world
as it is when it fires, not when you wrote it. Click the ledger row for the arithmetic.

**"Everything is `?/10`."** You are watching from the hill, or your lookout went home.
Eyes lapse three days after your last order.
