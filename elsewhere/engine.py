"""Elsewhere — V0.1 engine.

The one principle, borrowed from SEREN:
    The model narrates a result it did not choose.

Everything that decides an outcome happens in here, is seeded, and is written to
the ledger with its arithmetic showing. The narrator reads the ledger. It does
not get a vote.

Usage:

    python engine.py queue "a" "b" ...   set the action queue (max QUEUE_SLOTS)
    python engine.py tick [--now ISO]    advance the world to now, resolve queue
