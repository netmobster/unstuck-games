"""Three Bedrock jobs. None of them decide an outcome.

  interpret  — player sentence → engine parameters (JSON)
  narrate    — fog-safe ledger → briefing
  chronicle  — full settled ledger → story

Cheap by default: Nova Micro for mapping, Nova Lite for voice.
Falls back to templates if AWS is missing, so the prototype still plays.
